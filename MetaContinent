  + What is MetaMask digital wallet and what will it be used for?
  
If you want to fully enjoy the gaming space of the MetaContinent virtual commerce platform, we recommend that you purchase the MetaMask digital wallet. 
This digital wallet acts as your personal account, keeping all your digital assets (such as Avatars, NFT collectibles, LAND ownership items, buildings, vehicles, artifacts, smart things) and progress in the virtual world secure.
If you decide to take part in the gaming process without a digital wallet, the information will only be stored locally: you will be able to move in the gaming space and communicate with other players in the virtual environment, 
but you will not be able to earn money and participate in the commercial activities of the MetaContinent virtual environment.

+ Purpose of GAME MetaContinent?

Since the amount of resources is integrated into the Blockchain smart contract, it cannot be replaced by increasing or decreasing, thus players, having taken part in the initial stage of the MetaContinent game during the game, 
will increase their initial investment by at least x10, and at most x500.
But as you guessed, the amount of resources will still be limited by a smart contract, and like Bitcoin, the reward will be halved for every 25% of the total amount of resources mined on the territory of the gameplay. 
All resources will be mined by about 2024. By this time, there will be no need for the Sahara territories and this zone will automatically disappear. 
And all players will be able to direct their knowledge and skills to the playgrounds for the construction of the Metropolis and the MetaContinent Oasis.
The resource increase compiler for each land is provided anonymously and during the integration of the NFT land into MetaContinent, non-members, non-members of the development team do not know the total resource of an individual land.
Inspired by the successful Meta projects announced by the Facebook team, our project combines the best of both worlds - real profit for ordinary blockchain players who want to enjoy gameplay, and the MetaContinent ecosystem for players who want to collect, 
trade NFT and immerse themselves in virtual the world of the general Metaverse.
